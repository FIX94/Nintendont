### Nintendont
A Wii Homebrew Project to play GC Games on Wii and vWii on Wii U

### Building on Windows
* The latest versions of devkitPro will not work for building Nintendont on Windows
* As of this writing, it is still possible to find the old versions of devkitPPC, libogc, and devkitARM here: https://wii.leseratte10.de/devkitPro/
* I recommend installing the latest devkitPro and then overwriting the above mentioned folders with the following versions: devkitARM r47, devkitPPC r29-1, libogc 1.8.16

### Features:
* Works on Wii and Wii U (in vWii mode)
* Full-speed loading from a USB device or an SD card.
* Loads 1:1 and shrunken .GCM/.ISO disc images.
* Loads games as extracted files (FST format)
* Loads CISO-format disc images. (uLoader CISO format)
* Memory card emulation
* Play audio via disc audio streaming
* Bluetooth controller support (Classic Controller (Pro), Wii U Pro Controller)
* HID controller support via USB
* Custom button layout when using HID controllers
* Cheat code support
* Changeable configuration of various settings
* Reset/Power off via button combo (R + Z + Start) (R + Z + B + D-Pad Down)
* Advanced video mode patching, force progressive and force 16:9 widescreen
* Auto boot from loader
* Disc switching
* Use the official Nintendo GameCube controller adapter

### Features: (Wii only)
* Play retail discs
* Play backups from writable DVD media (Old Wii only)
* Use real memory cards
* GBA-Link cable
* WiiRd
* Allow use of the Nintendo GameCube Microphone

### What Nintendont doesn't do yet:
* BBA/Modem support

### What Nintendont will never support:
* Game Boy Player

### Quick Installation:
1. Get the [loader.dol](loader/loader.dol?raw=true), rename it to boot.dol and put it in /apps/Nintendont/ along with the files [meta.xml](nintendont/meta.xml?raw=true) and [icon.png](nintendont/icon.png?raw=true).
2. Copy your GameCube games to the /games/ directory. Subdirectories are optional for 1-disc games in ISO/GCM and CISO format.
   * For 2-disc games, you should create a subdirectory /games/MYGAME/ (where MYGAME can be anything), then name disc 1 as "game.iso" and disc 2 as "disc2.iso".
   * For extracted FST, the FST must be located in a subdirectory, e.g. /games/FSTgame/sys/boot.bin .
3. Connect your storage device to your Wii or Wii U and start The Homebrew Channel.
4. Select Nintendont.

### Notes
* The Wii and Wii U SD card slot is known to be slow. If you're using an SD card and are having performance issues, consider either using a USB SD reader or a USB hard drive.
* USB flash drives are known to be problematic.
* Nintendont runs best with storage devices formatted with 32 KB clusters. (Use either FAT32 or exFAT.)
