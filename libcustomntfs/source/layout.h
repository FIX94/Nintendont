 *
 * COLLATION_UNICODE_STRING - Collate Unicode strings by comparing their binary
 *	Unicode values, except that when a character can be uppercased, the
 *	upper case value collates before the lower case one.
 * COLLATION_FILE_NAME - Collate file names as Unicode strings. The collation
 *	is done very much like COLLATION_UNICODE_STRING. In fact I have no idea
 *	what the difference is. Perhaps the difference is that file names
 *	would treat some special characters in an odd way (see
 *	unistr.c::ntfs_collate_names() and unistr.c::legal_ansi_char_array[]
 *	for what I mean but COLLATION_UNICODE_STRING would not give any special
 *	treatment to any characters at all, but this is speculation.
 * COLLATION_NTOFS_ULONG - Sorting is done according to ascending u32 key
 *	values. E.g. used for $SII index in FILE_Secure, which sorts by
 *	security_id (u32).
 * COLLATION_NTOFS_SID - Sorting is done according to ascending SID values.
 *	E.g. used for $O index in FILE_Extend/$Quota.
 * COLLATION_NTOFS_SECURITY_HASH - Sorting is done first by ascending hash
 *	values and second by ascending security_id values. E.g. used for $SDH
 *	index in FILE_Secure.
 * COLLATION_NTOFS_ULONGS - Sorting is done according to a sequence of ascending
 *	u32 key values. E.g. used for $O index in FILE_Extend/$ObjId, which
 *	sorts by object_id (16-byte), by splitting up the object_id in four
 *	u32 values and using them as individual keys. E.g. take the following
 *	two security_ids, stored as follows on disk:
 *		1st: a1 61 65 b7 65 7b d4 11 9e 3d 00 e0 81 10 42 59
 *		2nd: 38 14 37 d2 d2 f3 d4 11 a5 21 c8 6b 79 b1 97 45
 *	To compare them, they are split into four u32 values each, like so:
 *		1st: 0xb76561a1 0x11d47b65 0xe0003d9e 0x59421081
 *		2nd: 0xd2371438 0x11d4f3d2 0x6bc821a5 0x4597b179
 *	Now, it is apparent why the 2nd object_id collates after the 1st: the
 *	first u32 value of the 1st object_id is less than the first u32 of
 *	the 2nd object_id. If the first u32 values of both object_ids were
 *	equal then the second u32 values would be compared, etc.

/*
 * Attribute compression.
 *
 * Only the data attribute is ever compressed in the current ntfs driver in
 * Windows. Further, compression is only applied when the data attribute is
 * non-resident. Finally, to use compression, the maximum allowed cluster size
 * on a volume is 4kib.
 *
 * The compression method is based on independently compressing blocks of X
 * clusters, where X is determined from the compression_unit value found in the
 * non-resident attribute record header (more precisely: X = 2^compression_unit
 * clusters). On Windows NT/2k, X always is 16 clusters (compression_unit = 4).
 *
 * There are three different cases of how a compression block of X clusters
 * can be stored:
 *
 *   1) The data in the block is all zero (a sparse block):
 *	  This is stored as a sparse block in the runlist, i.e. the runlist
 *	  entry has length = X and lcn = -1. The mapping pairs array actually
 *	  uses a delta_lcn value length of 0, i.e. delta_lcn is not present at
 *	  all, which is then interpreted by the driver as lcn = -1.
 *	  NOTE: Even uncompressed files can be sparse on NTFS 3.0 volumes, then
 *	  the same principles apply as above, except that the length is not
 *	  restricted to being any particular value.
 *
 *   2) The data in the block is not compressed:
 *	  This happens when compression doesn't reduce the size of the block
 *	  in clusters. I.e. if compression has a small effect so that the
 *	  compressed data still occupies X clusters, then the uncompressed data
 *	  is stored in the block.
 *	  This case is recognised by the fact that the runlist entry has
 *	  length = X and lcn >= 0. The mapping pairs array stores this as
 *	  normal with a run length of X and some specific delta_lcn, i.e.
 *	  delta_lcn has to be present.
 *
 *   3) The data in the block is compressed:
 *	  The common case. This case is recognised by the fact that the run
 *	  list entry has length L < X and lcn >= 0. The mapping pairs array
 *	  stores this as normal with a run length of X and some specific
 *	  delta_lcn, i.e. delta_lcn has to be present. This runlist entry is
 *	  immediately followed by a sparse entry with length = X - L and
 *	  lcn = -1. The latter entry is to make up the vcn counting to the
 *	  full compression block size X.
 *
 * In fact, life is more complicated because adjacent entries of the same type
 * can be coalesced. This means that one has to keep track of the number of
 * clusters handled and work on a basis of X clusters at a time being one
 * block. An example: if length L > X this means that this particular runlist
 * entry contains a block of length X and part of one or more blocks of length
 * L - X. Another example: if length L < X, this does not necessarily mean that
 * the block is compressed as it might be that the lcn changes inside the block
 * and hence the following runlist entry describes the continuation of the
 * potentially compressed block. The block would be compressed if the
 * following runlist entry describes at least X - L sparse clusters, thus
 * making up the compression block length as described in point 3 above. (Of
 * course, there can be several runlist entries with small lengths so that the
 * sparse entry does not follow the first data containing entry with
 * length < X.)
 *
 * NOTE: At the end of the compressed attribute value, there most likely is not
 * just the right amount of data to make up a compression block, thus this data
 * is not even attempted to be compressed. It is just stored as is, unless
 * the number of clusters it occupies is reduced when compressed in which case
 * it is stored as a compressed compression block, complete with sparse
 * clusters at the end.
