This is pretty much just libntfs-wii:/libntfs-2013.1.13.zip, only 2 things were modified,

source/ntfsinternal.c line 48 from

static const DISC_INTERFACE* get_io_usbstorage (void) {
48     { "usb", &__io_usbstorage },

to:

46 extern DISC_INTERFACE __io_custom_usbstorage;
49     { "usb", &__io_custom_usbstorage },

to run via nintendonts custom usbstorage.c.

and

source/Makefile added 
 28 export PORTLIBS := ../../loader/extlibs

because invoking make on sources with "@$(MAKE)" resets the PORTLIBS envvar to devkitppc defaults.

Installing
 make install
